# ProjectOpen
Another OpenComputers OS
# Features
It contains a simple shell interface to see all commands do `ls /bin/`
and for info on a command use either man or help to see how it is used.
I have plans for a package manager soon and auto completions so those 
will be added too
# Install
currently there is no installer all installs will either have to be done
through a git fetching script on a computer with an internet card or you
will have download this repo and put all the files into one of the drives
(using the data folder in Minecraft in your world)
